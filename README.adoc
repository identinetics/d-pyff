# Deploy pyFF using docker

A docker image for running a pyFF instance in daemon mode (mdx service and idp discovery as implemented by pyff/mdx).
The metadata aggregator start script assumes that the daemon is running (althout this could be changed easily).

As with any clean Docker image containers are immutable, i.e. a container can be removed and re-created
any time without loss of data, because persistent data is stored on mounted volumes.

The image is prepared for for metadata signature creation with pkcs#11 devices.

## Why using this docker image?

The pyff project includes a Dockerfile based on Ubuntu. The differences of this image are:

- Based on CentOS 7
- Based on 'dscripts' submodule, a thing wrapper around the Docker CLI to conveniently build, run and manage images and containers
- Does not start as root, drops capabilities and builds behind proxy. 
- Includes Jenkinsfile to test deployment with HSM-configuration
- Automatic generation of image build numbers for both source repo and dependency changes

## Prepare project and build the docker image

    git clone https://github.com/identinetics/docker-pyff
    cd docker-pyff
    git submodules update --init
    cp conf.sh.default conf.sh    # Use default or edit after copying
    ./dscripts/build.sh

## Usage: pyffd (IDP discovery and MDQ service)

Initialize mounted volumes with sample data (optional):
    
    ./dscripts/run.sh -ip init_sample.sh

Configure pyff: 
    Copy a default file to /etc/pyff/md_aggregate_sign.fd and adjust the settings.
    (/etc/pyff is the interal path of the container, see conf.sh for the external mapping)


Configure environment variables in conf.sh and start the daemon:

    FREQUENCY
    LOGLEVEL 
    PIDFILE
    PIPELINEDAEMON

    ./dscripts/run.sh
    curl http://localhost:8080
    
Take care of appropriate port mapping and/or proxying.

## Usage: pyFF (Aggregator running in batch mode)

Functional enhancements to pyFF:
- commit generated aggregate to git repo
- generate HTML pages for IDPs and SPs.

### Preconditions: 
* The container needs to be running already (usually as a pyffd). 
* The `docker run` command needs to contain:
    * 3 environment variables: LOGFILE, LOGLEVEL and PIPELINE;
    * Do not run pyff as root. Use the user defined with CONTAINERUSER in conf.sh

### Github authentication
If the git pull/push operations require authentication your need to provide a default ssh keypair
and register it with Github (Gitlab, ..) in the home directory of the container user, such as:

    dscripts/exec.sh
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    # add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub as a deploy key with write access to the remote repo
    ssh git@github.com  # validate that the github key fingerprint is valid
    git config --global push.default simple
     
### Run aggregator

Start pyff:
 
    # see exec_pyff_batch.sh -h for options with per-entity-descriptor outpout and git integration
    ./exec_pyff_batch.sh

Sample entry for /etc/crontab to run pyff every hour:

    29 *  *  *  *  root /docker_images/pyff/exec_pyff_batch.sh 2>&1 > /var/log/exec_pyff_batch.log
   
    
## HSM/pyFF config

Config the key name in md_aggregate_sign.fd to match the key name on the HSM.
(See the line with 'sign -> key')

Provide the PYKCS11PIN env variable if using the HSM.

## CI, Staging and Versioning

There is a Jenkinsfile for CI. To use it the jenkins user must be able to run docker.
